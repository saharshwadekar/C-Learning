STL - Standard template Library

Library of what?
    -> Generic classes and function 

Why use STL -> Reuse: Well test components
                & time savings!

components of STL ::
    1. Containers -> Stores data.
                  -> Use template classes.

                  1. sequence container -> Linear Fashion EG: 1 -> 2- > 5 -> 7
                                                           & Vector
                                                                    -> Random Access = Fast
                                                                    -> Insertion / Deletion in middle = Slow
                                                                    -> Insertion / Deletion at the end =  Fast
                                                                    
                                                           & List
                                                                    -> Random Access = Slow
                                                                    -> Insertion / Deletion in middle = Fast
                                                                    -> Insertion / Deletion at the end =  Fast

                                                           & Dequeue
                                                                      

                  2. Assosiative Container -> Direct access    Eg:Map / multiMap ,
                                            Fast Searching        Set / MultiSet

                                                                    All Operation is FAst except Random Access
                                                                    -> Random Access = Slow
                                                                    -> Insertion / Deletion in middle = Fast
                                                                    -> Insertion / Deletion at the end =  Fast


                  3. Derived Containers -> Real World Modeling  Eg: Stack 
                                                                    Queue
                                                                    Priority_Queue

                                                                    Depends upon Operation
                                                                        -> Data Structure.

    2. Algorithms -> Set of procedure to manipulate data in requirement.
                  -> Sorting.
                  -> Searching.
                  -> Use template classes.

    3. Iterators -> Object points to an element in a container
                 -> handled just like pointer
                 -> Connect Algorithm with container

    eg:

    container:: |   1   |    7   |   12    |     23  |   ...    |
                    <-                       ->  
                        Iterators moves as 
                           instructed 
                        by the Algorithm
