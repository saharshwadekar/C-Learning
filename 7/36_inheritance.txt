Inheritance
 
It's an OOP's part. 
Reusiblity saves times as well as money.
DRY :- Do not Repeat Yourself.
We can reuse a class and add additional features to it.


1. single Inheritance: A derive class with one base class

Programmer                                Employee
                    -derives->
                A  ----------->  B
                 <-is derive from-

2. multiple Inheritance : A derived class with more than one base class 

    Employee            Assistant
        A                   B
        |                   |
        ---------------------
                 |
                 C
             Programmer

3. Herarchical Inheritance :  Several derived classes from a single base class
             
                   Employee
                      C
                      |
            ---------------------
            |                   |
            A                   B
        Programmer           Manager

4. MultiLevel Inheritance : Deriving a class from already derived class

        A       animal
        |
        B       mammal
        |
        C       Bat

5. Hybrid Inheritance : Hybrid Inheritanceis a combination of multiple inheritance adn MultiLevel inheritance.
        * A class is derived from two class in multiple inheritance
        * However , one of tha parents classes is not a base class

                      Animal
                         A           
                         |
                 ----------------
                 |               |  
  mammal         B               C       Aves(Bird)
                 |               |  
                 ----------------
                         |
                         D
                     (ostrich)
